# jeep-treads
when making skins for Pavlov-VR jeep it has bald tires this lets u fix it  

hey so i made a thingy that lets u edit  the intensity on the jeep wheels its really kinda pointless and im sure most ppl never even noticed how bald there tires are but i care about your safety   

it only edits the read sction of the tire so it wont make other things look bad 
file too big for git :( its on discord sorry
